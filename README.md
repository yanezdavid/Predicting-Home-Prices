# Predicting-Home-Prices
Using the Boston Housing Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing), I predict the value of homes.

1. I clean the data, removing outliers, fixing missing values and duplicates.
2. I perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), providing data visualizations with general insights, trends, and relationships among the data.
3. I use RandomForestRegressor, XGBoost Regression, and a KNeighborsRegressor to predict home prices. 
4. I cluster the data using unsupervised methods (KMeans) to gain insights on the relationships between variables and home price.
