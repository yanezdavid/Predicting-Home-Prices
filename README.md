# Predicting-Home-Prices
Using the Boston Housing Dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/c/boston-housing), I predict the value of homes.

1. I clean the data for analysis and machine learning.
2. I perform an EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to visualize trends and relationships in the data.
3. I use Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost Regressor, KNeighbors Regressor, and an ensemble model to predict home prices from the dataset.
4. I cluster the data using unsupervised methods (KMeans) to gain insights on the relationships between variables and home price.
